      <p>${ c.config.get('event_shortname') } is a grass-roots conference and needs enthusiastic people like you to make it a success! This is a great opportunity to be seen by your peers and give back to the community.</p>

      <p>Volunteers will be expected to attend a training course which will walk them thru tasks such as operating cameras, registering people, etc. Training courses will be held in mid-December, mid-January, and on the weekend before the conference.</p>
